# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Fill in the following details:
   - **Repository name**: `code-organizer`
   - **Description**: `A comprehensive tool to scan, analyze, and organize scattered source code across your entire computer`
   - **Visibility**: Public âœ“
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run this command from your project directory:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Details

- **Local repository**: Already initialized âœ“
- **Initial commit**: Created âœ“
- **Remote configured**: `https://github.com/molaw/code-organizer.git` âœ“
- **Branch name**: `main` âœ“
- **Files committed**: 22 files, 4518 lines âœ“

## What's Included in the Initial Commit

### Project Structure
- Complete modular architecture
- Phase 1A Quick Scanner (fully functional)
- Phase 1B, 1C, Phase 2 (structure ready for implementation)

### Features Implemented
- Fast project type detection (.NET, Python, Arduino, Node.js, Docker, C/C++)
- Quick wins identification (build artifacts, caches, empty folders)
- Security issue detection (credentials, private keys)
- Duplicate detection based on name patterns
- Beautiful CLI output with Rich library
- Click-based command-line interface
- Comprehensive YAML configuration system

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.12
- Rich (terminal UI)
- Click (CLI framework)
- GitPython (for git analysis)
- Pandas, Plotly (for reports)
- All dependencies managed with uv

## Quick Start After Push

Users can clone and use your tool:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/molaw/code-organizer.git
cd code-organizer

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Run quick scan
uv run python main.py scan-quick --paths ~/Documents
```

## Next Development Steps

After pushing, you can continue development:

1. **Phase 1B**: Deep analysis with comprehensive git operations
2. **Phase 1C**: Interactive review mode
3. **Phase 2**: Organization and cleanup operations with safety features

## Repository URL

Once created, your repository will be at:
**https://github.com/molaw/code-organizer**
