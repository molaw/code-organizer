## üéÅ Quick Wins - Safe to Remove

| Category         | Count | Total Size |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| Build Artifacts  | 4     | 37.2 MB    |
| **TOTAL SAVINGS**| **4** | **37.2 MB**|

**Details:**
- Found 4 build artifact directories (`__pycache__`, `obj/Debug`, etc.)
- These can be safely removed as they are regenerated during builds
- Potential space savings: 37.2 MB

---

## üîí Security

‚úÖ **No obvious security issues detected!**

The quick scanner checks for:
- Private SSH keys (id_rsa, .pem files)
- Credentials files (credentials.json, secrets.json)
- Environment files (.env)
- API keys

---

## üîÑ Duplicate Detection

**Found 1 potential duplicate pair:**

1. **CWIC** <-> **CWIC**
   - These appear to be duplicates based on name pattern
   - Deep scan (Phase 1B) will provide detailed analysis
   - Can compare file contents, git history, and modification dates

---

## üì¶ Empty Folders

**Found 363 empty folders**

Examples:
- `EIDashboard_Autoshell\obj\Debug\TempPE` (build artifacts)
- `PyQt_CMMS_Environment\Include` (virtual environment remnants)
- `pandas\api\extensions\__pycache__` (Python cache directories)
- `pandas\core\arrays\sparse` (empty library folders)
- ... and 353 more

**Note:** Many of these are from:
- Virtual environments (.venv, venv folders)
- Build output directories
- Python package cache directories

---

## üìà Performance

- **Scan Speed:** ~3 seconds for entire directory tree
- **Depth:** Scanned 6 projects across multiple subdirectories
- **Files Analyzed:** Thousands of files checked
- **Memory Efficient:** Minimal memory footprint

---
